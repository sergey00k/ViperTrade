## Getting Up and Running

### Install & Build

1. `npm install --save --legacy-peer-deps react-kawaii `
2. `cd functions`
3. `npm install`
4. Add secrets as explained in "Handling Secrets"
5. `npm run build`
6. `cd ..`
7. `npm run build`

Note: there is currently a bug in chakra-ui that causes builds to fail see this [issue](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/issues/5714).
The best way to resolve it for now is to replace "ColorAdjust" with "PrintColorAdjust" at
"node_modules/@chakra-ui/menu/dist/declarations/src/use-menu.d.ts:480:50" and "node_modules/@chakra-ui/menu/dist/declarations/src/use-menu.d.ts:986:61"

### Serving

After building you can serve the application using by running `firebase emulators:start` and `npm run preview`

### Hot Reloading

When developing you don't need to build the app but can use `firebase emulators:start` and `npm run dev`.
Note that while the frontend is rebuilt automatically the backend must be recompiled before you can serve new versions.

## Storing secrets

Secrets must be stored in a name with the format `secrets.ts` in the `functions/src/` directory.
(This ensures that they are ignored by git.) You get the secrets from [blockfrost](https://blockfrost.io).

Example:

```typescript
export const BLOCKFROST_ID_MAINNET = "...";
export const BLOCKFROST_ID_TESTNET = "...";
```
